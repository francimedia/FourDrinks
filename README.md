# Fourdrinks

FourDrinks lets you pick a place, invite some friends, and meet up for drinks, minus the hassle.

## History

FourDrinks (aka "Let's get drinks") was originally build at the 2013 Foursquare Hackathon in NYC (https://www.hackerleague.org/hackathons/foursquare-hackathon-2013/hacks/fourdrinks-aka-lets-get-drinks).
This is a rebuild using brunch.io
